        <strong>web</strong> is a simple, interactive, self-education app for
        anyone wanting to learn web design and development.
        <strong>web</strong> puts a strong <em>emphasis</em> on progressive
        learning - When introducing new concepts, only the most basic and easy
        to understand ideas are covered first, then, in later modules previous
        knowledge is built on with increasingly more complex ideas. Web doesn't
        teach you irrelavent information you won't ever use in the real world.
        <strong><span>Our goal</span></strong>: Give as much useful information 
        as possible in as simple and as short amount of time as possible.
